# CamelRedirect

https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/camelredirect/

This extension opens an Amazon page's respective Camel Camel Camel page on supported countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, & US). See the source code for a more detailed overview of how the extension works.

The extension listens for either a click on the browser icon or a hotkey (Alt + Shift + D). Once it is called, the extension pulls the current tab's URL and checks if it is an Amazon tab. It then finds out if it is a supported country and then opens the products respective, regional Camel Camel Camel page. If it isn't an Amazon page, or if the country is not supported by Camel Camel Camel, the extension does nothing.
